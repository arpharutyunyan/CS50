"""
        FIGlet, named after Frank, Ian, and Glenâ€™s letters, is a program from the early 1990s for making large letters out of ordinary text, 
        a form of ASCII art:

        _ _ _          _   _     _
        | (_) | _____  | |_| |__ (_)___
        | | | |/ / _ \ | __| '_ \| / __|
        | | |   <  __/ | |_| | | | \__ \
        |_|_|_|\_\___|  \__|_| |_|_|___/
        Among the fonts supported by FIGlet are those at figlet.org/examples.html.

        FIGlet has since been ported to Python as a module called pyfiglet.

        In a file called figlet.py, implement a program that:

        Expects zero or two command-line arguments:
        Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
        Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font, in which case the first of the two should be -f or --font, and the second of the 
        two should be the name of the font.
        Prompts the user for a str of text.
        Outputs that text in the desired font.
        If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not -f or --font or the second is not the name of a font, the program should 
        exit via sys.exit with an error message.
